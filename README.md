# chrome-dino-automator
Chrome Dino Game Automation in Python

Works... to "an" extent. When starting the dino game, zoom your Chrome window to 400% and then start the bot and click the game in Chrome to start it. The bot waits for 5 seconds before starting. It will most likely execute an auto jump once, but the program runs into an index out of bounds error then and aborts the bot. I've tried adjusting the window size for the bot, alas I'm not quite sure why that happens.
