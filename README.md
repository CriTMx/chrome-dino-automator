# chrome-dino-automator
Chrome Dino Game Automation in Python

Works... to an extent. When starting the dino game, zoom your Chrome window to 400% and then start the bot and click the game in Chrome to start it. The bot waits for 5 seconds before starting. It will likely fail certain types of jumps such as triple cacti.
Press E to abort the bot.
